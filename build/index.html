				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
				Before I started writing code, I taught English as a Second Language to international students as an adjunct.  Just when I was starting to wonder what the heck I was doing getting paid next to nothing and working every weekend, I adopted my dog Annie and she brought some real perspective to my life.  I realized that teaching was not going to be sustainable in the long term.</p>

				<p>So I started researching careers, and along the way someone recommended that I take a programming course at UW.  That was followed by a second course in web programming, which I fell in love with and led me to Edmonds’ Certificate program and my current internship at Jolkona.org.</p>

				<p>What I love about web programming is the ability to solve actual problems that have a concrete solution.  These solutions usually serve an actual purpose in real life.  It’s so fun to spend hours trying out different ideas and combinations until you find one that really works.  I’m not sure exactly which specific direction I’ll take in this field, but I’m certainly <span style="background-color: #66CCCC; ">enjoying the learning process </span> right now.</p>

				<p>When I’m not writing code and Googling web development, I spend time at Discovery Park with Annie, bake pies and cookies, blog, work on my house, hang out with my friends and family, and try to take advantage of all Seattle has to offer.</p>
